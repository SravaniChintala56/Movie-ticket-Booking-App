A responsive movie ticket booking web application built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript — designed to mimic real-world booking platforms like BookMyShow. This project was built as part of learning core JavaScript concepts without using any external frameworks or libraries. 🔐 Login Page: A login form with regex validation for New username and password. Ensures users enter valid credentials before accessing the booking system. 🚀 Features: Home Page: Movie Search & Filtering Search bar with real-time suggestions Filter movies by genre,category,location,rating.

🎥 Movie Details Page: View movie posters, descriptions, trailers, and ratings Submit and view user reviews

🎟️ Booking Functionality Select date, theater, showtime, ticket count. Price calculation based on ticket count. Buttons enabled only after all required fields are selected.

Timer starts after booking confirmation. After the movie ends, it removes that movie from localStorage. Data is stored and retrieved using localStorage.

This project was built for the purpose of mastering JavaScript fundamentals, DOM manipulation, event handling, regex usage, and dynamic UI updates — all without any libraries or frameworks.
